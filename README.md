**[Quarry](https://github.com/QuarryProtocol/quarry)** is an open protocol for launching liquidity mining programs on Solana. It's used notably by Saber and other Solana programs. It allows a user to stake their own tokens in a liquidity pool.
 
**Proxy Quarry** allows a program to mine on behalf of a user. A user stakes their token in the program and that program is the miner for the quarry. This can be useful for time locked vault projects.
